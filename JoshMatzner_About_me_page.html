<p> Greetings and salutations, fellow LIS enthusiasts! My name is Josh (or Joshua, I've never really cared which name people use) and I am an LIS graduate student from Sioux Falls South Dakota, who graduated from Augustana University with majors in Fine Arts and Media Studies.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Why I chose the LIS Field?</h3>
    <p> I chose the LIS field as to follow in the footsteps of the librarians who helped me throughout my primary education. I have Asperger's Syndrome and ADHD, and as a child I often found that paying attention and staying on task to be incredibly difficult. What I truly appreciate about the librarians from my elementary, middle school and high school is that they were always patient, kind, and understanding, and I'd like to do the same for someone else. </p>
   
    <br>
    <h3> Plans for Post-Grad </h3>
    <p> My plans for post-graduate program are rather simple. Get a job, earn money, don't lose health insurance. My desired goals for post-graduate program are to get a job either in archiving, reference, or in a library's media section. </p>
